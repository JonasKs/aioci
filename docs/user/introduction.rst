Introduction
============

Goals
-----

PyACI was designed with the following goals in mind.

#. Provide a set of minimal, intuitive, and consistent API constructs.
#. Provide a simple Python abstraction over ACI REST API, and managed objects.
#. Option to use XML or JSON payload.

Status
------

PyACI is the Official Python bindings for Cisco Cloud Application
Centric Infrastructure (CAPIC). PyACI is also stronly suggested for
using with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (APIC), instead of
Cobra SDK (still shipping as official Python SDK for APIC).
With a single installation of PyACI it's possible to program different
version of APIC and CAPIC just by refering different version of the
metadata.

PyACI is out since a while, so has a stable set of core APIs.
New APIs might be added but no plan is there to change the existing
ones in non-backward compatible fashion.
